(** [init_game num_players] is a new game with [num_players] players and
    all initial defaults. *)

(** [place_plant game plant coord] is [game] with [plant] placed at
    [coord] in the board, the available plants of type
    [Plant.plant_stage plant] of the player corresponding to
    [Plant.player_id plant] decremented by 1, and the store of the plant
    stage that [plant] is replacing, [last_plant], incremented by 1, if
    [last_plant] exists, and if the store of [last_plant] is full
    (otherwise, it will stay the same, meaning the replaced plant was
    thrown away). Raises: [Board.InvalidPlantPlacement] if placing
    [plant] at [coord] is an illegal move;

    does not have any of [Plant.plant_stage plant] in their available

    more plant of [stage] in their available area. Raises:
    [Store.InsufficientLightPoints] if Player does not have enough light
    points to buy a plant of [stage];

(* In the future, we may want to alert the UI that photosynthesis is
   about to happen instead of just lumping photosynthesis in with

    who plays after the current player, and with photosynthesis
    performed if appropriate. *)

(** [is_store_full game player_id stage] is true iff the number of
