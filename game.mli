(** [plant_seed player_id coord game] is game with a seed of [player]
    planted at [coord] and the available seeds of the player decremented
    by 1. Raises: [Board.IllegalPlacePlant] if planting a seed at
    [coord] is an illegal move; [PlantInventory.OutOfPlant Plant.Seed]

    decremented by 1. Raises: [Board.IllegalPlacePlant] if planting a
    seed at [coord] is an illegal move;
    [PlantInventory.OutOfPlant Plant.Small] if the player does not have
    any small trees in their available area. See [can_plant_small] and

    points to buy a plant of [stage];
    [PlantInventory.OutOfPlant (Plant.plant_stage plant)] if the player
    does not have any of [Plant.plant_stage plant] in their store. *)

(** [end_turn game] is [game] with control relinquished to the player
    who plays after the current player, and with photosynthesis
    performed if appropriate. If [game] is not in setup, photosynthesis
    is accompanied by the direction of the sun moving and the number of
    rounds being incremented. Photosynthesis is performed when moving
    from setup to the normal game, and whenever a round in the normal
    game ends. *)
