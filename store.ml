open Plant

(** A list of indices that point to the current cost of the next [Plant]
    of its type. The value at index 0 points to the cost of the next
    [Seed] which is in the int list at index 0 of costs, at index 1
    points to the cost of the next [Small] plant which is in the int
    list at index 1 in costs, and so on. The number of indices in [t]
    should always match the number of [Plant.plant_stage]s, and the
    value of the indices should be in bounds of its respective int list
    in costs. *)
