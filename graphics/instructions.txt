| Summary: Using their light points (LP), players take their trees through their   |
| life cycles, from seedlings to fully grown. Players harvest their large trees to |
| collect scoring points (SP), which are proportional to the richness of the soil  |
| on which the trees grew. The sun will move around the board after every round,   |
| and trees will gain light points according to how tall they are, if they are not |
| blocked from the sun by any trees of equal or greater height. Light points can   |
| be redeemed to buy, plant, and grow trees on a player's turn. when plants are    |
| removed from the board, they are returned to the player's store, but if there is |
| no more room, they are automatically thrown away. The player or players with the |
| most scoring points at the end of the game win.                                  |
