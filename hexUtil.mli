(** Type representing the position of a flat-topped hexagon in axial
    coordinates. [col] increases from left to right when viewed via the

    when [dir = 2] or [dir = 3], and [c1.col + 1 = c2.col] when
    [dir = 0] or [dir = 5]. Likewise, [diag] increases from the
    bottom-left of the map to the top-right. *)

(** The type representing directions on the hexagonal board. [dir]
    represents [60 * dir + 30] degrees counterclockwise from the
    horizontal. Valid [dir] values are the integers between 0-5,
    inclusive. *)

(** [move_cw dir] is [dir] after it moves clockwise once. *)
