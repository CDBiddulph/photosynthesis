(** [init_gui store_costs init_available init_next_sp cells player_params]
    is the GUI for a board of cells, constructed from the ground up. A
    hexagon will be created in every place corresponding to a Some value
    in [cells]. Then, [update_cells cells] will be called. The colors
    and chars of [player_params] will be used to render the trees of
    each individual player. The store and available area, when they are
    updated, will render according to the player id that equals 1 in
    [player_params]. The store will have capacities according to length
    of each list in [store_costs], in order of [Plant.all_stages]. The
    cost of each plant in the store will correspond to the costs in
    [store_costs]. The available area will have [init_available] numbers
    of plants in each row, in order of [Plant.all_stages]. The displayed
    scoring points will be initialized to [init_next_sp], which should
    be given in the order of the soil types 1, 2, 3, 4, but will be
    displayed in the order of 4, 3, 2, 1. Precondition: for all values
    [sp] in [init_next_sp], [sp >= 0 && sp < 100] *)
